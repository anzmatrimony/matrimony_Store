                <p>
                    Your child is invited to take part and thank you have already registered in the 2017 International competitions and Assessments for schools conducted by the University of New South Wales Educational Testing Centre. The competitions take each year in schools throughout Australia. They provide an opportunity for all students to gain a measure of their own achievement in an external situation. <strong>Two (2) new tests have been added this year.</strong>

                </p>
                <p>Four (4) tests are now open to Year 2.</p>
                <p>Please note that the sitting of these tests may not be appropriate for every student. The competitions are challenging and are not in line with the NSW Curriculum (ie. They are completely independent of the NSW Department of Education). Therefore, the school does not consider these competitions for assessment purpose as they are not measurable against any NSW assessment or curriculum. Below is a list the competition dates and the cost for each test.
